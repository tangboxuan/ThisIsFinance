        <tr><td>CS1101S</td><td>Programming Methodology</td>
        <td colspan="2"><p>This module introduces the concepts of programming and computational problem solving, and is the first and foremost introductory module to computing. Starting from a small core of fundamental abstractions, the module introduces programming as a method for communicating computational processes. The module begins with purely functional programming based on a simple substitution-based execution model, and ends with a powerful modern imperative language based on a realistic environment-based execution model. Topics covered include: functional abstraction, recursion, higher-order functions, data abstraction, algorithmic strategies, state mutation, loops and arrays, evaluation strategies, sorting and searching, debugging and testing.</p></td></tr>
        <tr><td>CS1231S</td><td>Discrete Structures</td>
        <td colspan="2"><p>This module introduces mathematical tools required in the study of computer science. Topics include: (1) Logic and proof techniques: propositions, conditionals, quantifications. (2) Relations and Functions: Equivalence relations and partitions. Partially ordered sets. Well-Ordering Principle. Function equality. Boolean/identity/inverse functions. Bijection. (3) Mathematical formulation of data models (linear model, trees, graphs). (4) Counting and Combinatoric: Pigeonhole Principle. Inclusion-Exclusion Principle. Number of relations on a set, number of injections from one finite set to another, Diagonalization proof: An infinite countable set has an uncountable power set; Algorithmic proof: An infinite set has a countably infinite subset. Subsets of countable sets are countable.</p></td></tr>
        <tr><td>CS2040S</td><td>Data Structures & Algorithms</td>
        <td colspan="2"><p>This module introduces students to the design and implementation of fundamental data structures and algorithms. The module covers basic data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, binary heaps, trees, and graphs), searching and sorting algorithms, and basic analysis of algorithms.</p></td></tr>
        <tr><td>CS2100</td><td>Computer Organisation</td>
        <td colspan="2"><p>The objective of this module is to familiarise students with the fundamentals of computing devices. Through this module students will understand the basics of data representation, and how the various parts of a computer work, separately and with each other. This allows students to understand the issues in computing devices, and how these issues affect the implementation of solutions. Topics covered include data representation systems, combinational and sequential circuit design techniques, assembly language, processor execution cycles, pipelining, memory hierarchy and input/output systems.</p></td></tr>
        <tr><td>CS2107</td><td>Introduction to Information Security</td>
        <td colspan="2"><p>This module serves as an introductory module on information security. It illustrates the fundamentals of how systems fail due to malicious activities and how they can be protected. The module also places emphasis on the practices of secure programming and implementation. Topics covered include classical/historical ciphers, introduction to modern ciphers and cryptosystems, ethical, legal and organisational aspects, classic examples of direct attacks on computer systems such as input validation vulnerability, examples of other forms of attack such as social engineering/phishing attacks, and the practice of secure programming.</p></td></tr>
        <tr><td>MA1101R</td><td>Linear Algebra I</td>
        <td colspan="2"><p>This module is a first course in linear algebra. Fundamental concepts of linear algebra will be introduced and investigated in the context of the Euclidean spaces R^n. Proofs of results will be presented in the concrete setting. Students are expected to acquire computational facilities and geometric intuition with regard to vectors and matrices. Some applications will be presented. Major topics: Systems of linear equations, matrices, determinants, Euclidean spaces, linear combinations and linear span, subspaces, linear independence, bases and dimension, rank of a matrix, inner products, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, diagonalization, linear transformations between Euclidean spaces, applications.</p></td></tr>
        <tr><td>GER1000</td><td>Quantitative Reasoning</td>
        <td colspan="2"><p>This module aims to equip undergraduates with basic reasoning skills on using data to address real world issues. What are some potential complications to keep in mind as we plan what data to collect and how to use them to address our particular issue? When two things are related (e.g. smoking and cancer), how can we tell whether the relationship is causal (e.g. smoking causes cancer)? How can quantitative reasoning help us deal with uncertainty or elucidate complex relationships? These and other questions will be discussed using real world examples.</p></td></tr>
        <tr><td>UWC2101H</td><td>Writing & Critical Thinking: Power, Space and Pleasure</td>
        <td colspan="2"><p>In this module, we will investigate how technoscience shapes contemporary forms of power, space, and everyday pleasure. Technoscience describes the potent combination of technological innovation with scientific methods that allows us to better know and structure our world. Government and industry decision-making processes rely upon technoscientific techniques of quantification, calculation, and standardisation. How are authoritative facts produced and used to manage people, things, and spaces? How do perceptions of scientific and technological achievement influence policies? Everyday human activities are increasingly structured through scientific knowledge and complex arrays of technology. Gamification through smart devices and self-monitoring via portable tech offer new pleasures and new possibilities for living. To what extent are we changed by the technologies we invent? Who in society benefits from data and expertise? And what impact do sophisticated new technologies have on people and their environments? This module draws on perspectives from the broad interdisciplinary field of Science and Technology Studies to reflect on questions relating to the power of technoscientific knowledge, the role of experts and innovators in creating spatialised networks, and the pleasures and dangers of technologically enhanced living.</p></td></tr>
        <tr><td>UHB2214</td><td>Effective Decision Making</td>
        <td colspan="2"><p>Research has established that we often fall prey to cognitive biases unknowingly, leading to us making suboptimum decisions. This module seeks to examine some of these biases and how they affect our decision making as we re-look at decision making theories (Game Theory).
            In this module, we seek answers to the question of, “What constitutes a good decision and what makes for a good decision maker?”     
            We will also discuss the implications of these biases from the social welfare perspective and explores how we can overcome these biases.</p></td></tr>
        <tr><td>UQR2216</td><td>Thoughtful Learning with Machines</td>
        <td colspan="2"><p>“Is that the same as Machine Learning without tears?”  Well, thoughts and tears both germinate near the top of the body, so maybe there are some connections.
            However, the aim here is to become familiar with Artificial Intelligence, with appreciation for what it is and can be, rather than for deep dives into theories and programming.
            This is a tools-and-soft-skills module introducing Python machine learning, with hands-on modelling via pre-programmed templates.  Students will be gently ushered into the artificial intelligence landscape, so that they might henceforth — as an insider — keep abreast with the ecosystem’s constant reshaping.
            Broad appreciation of introduced models from a decision-maker’s perspective will be emphasized.  Students will learn to communicate responsively and congenially with senior management and technical colleagues alike.
            They will be equipped to thoughtfully follow the accelerating analytics transformations within modern organizations.  Graduates may then deservedly take a seat with enlightened movers and shakers digitizing future workplaces.
            Students must be quantitatively inclined — to banish any sprouting teary setting — and should aspire to be motivators in structural data-centric makeovers.  It is expected that most students will hence be consistently adding to their knowledge of artificial intelligence and machine learning, and keeping up with trends of the novel models’ adoptions and fruitful implementations in the economy at large.
            STEM students will be particularly required to hone their summary writing and verbal presentation skills, while other students will be especially prepared to dream along the data dimension in their future personal as well as corporate decision-making.</p></td></tr>
        <tr><td>ACC1701</td><td>Accounting for Decision Makers</td>
        <td colspan="2"><p>The course provides an introduction to accounting from a user perspective. Financial reporting is covered from the viewpoint of an external investor. The focus is on how accounting can help investors make better decisions. Book-keeping and preparation of financial statements are also covered at an introductory level, as investors need to be aware of how the financial statements are derived.</p></td></tr>
        <tr><td>BSP1702</td><td>Legal Environment of Business</td>
        <td colspan="2"><p>This course will equip business students with basic legal knowledge relating to commercial transactions so that they will be more aware of potential legal problems which may arise in the course of business and having become aware, to have recourse to such professional legal advice as is necessary in the circumstances. Subjects that meet these requirements include the Singapore Legal System, mediation and arbitration to resolve disputes, the types of various business organisations for businesses to conduct effectively within the law, directors' duties & liabilities, the making of valid business contracts and the rights & obligations of traders in the market place and negligence in the business environment through misstatements.</p></td></tr>

        <td>Reason and Reality</td>
        <td><p>What is it about the world that makes it hospitable to our inquiry? What kind of a being do we have to be, to see inquiry into the nature of things worthy of effort? One ancient answer—versions of which continue to underpin important aspects of modern inquiry—says that the world is hospitable to our inquiry because it is ultimately rational, and we are able to seek knowledge about it because of the power of reason. In this modulet, we consider the power and limitation of reason's ability to give us knowledge about the human and natural world. We will begin historically with Zeno's Paradox, using the ancient Greek thinker's argument against the possibility of motion as a starting point. We will then focus on human moral responsibility within the backdrop of a deterministic physical universe as a case study, considering both a powerful argument against the idea that we have any such responsibility and some responses to it.</p></td></tr>
        <tr><td>The Nature of Reality</td>
        <td><p>What is the nature of reality and how do we probe it? Scientists and philosophers, in their quest to uncover and understand this reality, are guided by the believe that nature, the embodiment of this reality, is orderly and acts according to immutable laws, that are more often than not, mathematical. The ubiquity of mathematics in the natural laws have led some to question its role. How do we account for the fact that mathematics is so effective in describing nature? Do mathematical constructs such as numbers and geometry point beyond themselves to a higher reality? Is it mere language or is it the reality itself?  These and other questions will be the focus of this modulet.</p></td></tr>
        <tr><td>Knowledge and Society</td>
        <td><p>How do we know what we know? Philosophers have traditionally examined this question mainly by focusing on individuals. Human beings, however, are social beings. So, it seems very likely that the way we learn about the world will be shaped by our social environment. This module will examine the implications of understanding inquiry from a social perspective. We begin by examining our dependence on testimony for many of our everyday beliefs. We then move to understanding how social norms shape our epistemic environment. Finally, we’ll examine the implications of our discussion for the learning environment we hope to build here at USP.</p></td></tr>
        <tr><td>Society in Numbers</td>
        <td><p>I love being wrong. I like you, often take the majority view. If I can prove myself wrong, two things happen: 1. I’m more convinced than ever that my new perspective is right. 2. My opinion tends to be unique to my peer group, and as such is often insightful. Not coincidentally two things are also the foundation for good social science research. So how do we prove ourselves wrong? One way is too look at data in a way that can disprove our current beliefs - a process that underpins all science - falsification. In this modulet we explore our beliefs through that process together.</p></td></tr>
